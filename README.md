# Binary-Image-Classification-System-to-Identify-Oil-Spills-in-Ocean-Imagery

∗ Implemented a binary image classification system using VGG-19 CNN and various machine learning models to accurately
detect and identify oil spills in ocean imagery, achieving high prediction accuracy and enhancing environmental
monitoring capabilities.
∗ Developed and tested the system using a dataset of ocean images, employing data augmentation techniques and advanced
image pre-processing methods to improve model performance and reliability for real-time oil spill detection and response
